# 2023-Advanced-Waterloo-University-J2-Question-Most-Simplest-Way-
This is the 2nd question of the junior level of 2023 Java questions of the Waterloo University. It is very advanced university question and my code is the simplest way to do it, only using very simple concepts. (If you don't want to use cases, you can just use if statements for the different spices)
